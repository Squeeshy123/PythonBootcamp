# The `else` and `elif` statements and more conditional operators


### These can be added on after an `if` block to execute if the statement is *not* true
```python
some_bool = False # < Booleans are always captialized (in python)

if some_bool:
    print("The Boolean is true!")
else:
    print("The Boolean is false!")
```
Output:
```
The Boolean is false!
```

### Using the `elif` you can add more conditions and outcomes to you program.
```python
some_cheese = "Gouda" # < Booleans are always captialized (in python)

if some_cheese == "Gouda":
    print("The Boolean is true!")
else:
    print("The Boolean is false!")
```
Output:
```
The Boolean is false!
```

### There is also other conditional operators, like `and`, `or`, `not`

```python
some_cheese = input("What cheese you want? ")
how_much    = eval(input("How much you want? "))
if some_cheese == "Provelone" or some_cheese == "Bleu" and how_much < 10:
    print("Why on earth would you ever want those?")
elif how_much > 10:
    print("that's wayyy to much bucko.")
else:
    print("Alright I'll bag these up for ya.")
```
Output:
```
What cheese you want? Gouda
How much you want? 15
that's wayyy to much bucko.
```
