# Chapter 2 Loops and flow control!

# 2.1: The `if` statement

### If statments will only run if the provided statement is true.

```python
some_bool = True

if some_bool:
    print("The Boolean is true!")
```
Output:
```
The Boolean is true!
```

### Just like the print statement and pretty much any function, you can put anything in the if statement.


```python
class SomeObject:
    some_data = 0

obj = SomeObject()
if SomeObject:
    print("Some object is valid!")
```
Output:
```
Some object is true!
```

### Semi colons also start blocks of code!

## Indentation defines blocks of code in python! use the `Tab` key to indent in vscode.

### You can use things called conditional operators like greater than and less than: `>` or `<`

```python 
number = 1000

if number > 9000:
    print("I'm not going to make a dragon ball z reference")
if number < 9000:
    print("Yay! I don't have to make a dragon ball z reference!")
```
Output:
```
Yay! I don't have to make a dragon ball z reference!
```

### You can also use the `==` operator to test if two objects are equal (Objects being either ints, bools, classes, etc)

```python
users_number = eval(input("Guess a number: "))
number_to_guess = 1000
if users_number == number_to_guess:
    print("Yay! you did it! There is no prize.")
```
Output:
```
Guess a number: 1000
Yay! you did it! There is no prize.
```
