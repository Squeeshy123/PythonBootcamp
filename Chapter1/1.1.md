# Python Bootcamp Chapter 1
## 1.1: Printin' stuff

To write stuff to the console you use the `print()` function like so:

```python 
print("Hello, world!")
```
Output:

> Hello, world!



### You can put anything in the print function
```python
print(69420)

class SomeObject: # you don't need to know about this yet, this is just for example.
    some_data = 0

object = SomeObject()

print(object)
```

Output:
```
69420

<__main__.SomeObject object at 0x0000023282F2F5F8>
```

### You can print multiple things, or concatenate them into one thing!
```python
print("one", "two", "three")
```
Output:
```
one two three
```
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Or you can do concatenation:
```python
print("one " + "two " + "three ")
#         ^        ^          ^   make sure you have these spaces, or it will look weird!
```
Output:
```
one two three
```


&nbsp;

### You can even change certain parts of the print function
```python
print(12345, end=" this is what is at the end of the print\n")
```

> 12345 this is what is at the end of the print

#### or even like this
```python
print("The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumped", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog", sep="|")
```
Output:
> The|quick|brown|fox|jumped|over|the|lazy|dog

#### VS.
```python
print("The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumped", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog")
```
Ouput:
> The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
