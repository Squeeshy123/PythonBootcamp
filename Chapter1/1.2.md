# 1.2: Declaring variables and accepting input

### Variables work just how they do in algebra.
&nbsp; &nbsp; you assign value with the '=' sign
```python
funny_number = 69420
print("Funny number:", funny_number)
```
```
Funny number: 69420
```

### You can do math in python too
```python
math_number = 100 * 256
print("What is 100 * 256?", math_number)
```

```
25600
```

### You can even accept input using variables and the `input()` function

### The input function will print out a string as a prompt

```python
user_input = input("What do you want to say? ")
print("You:", user_input)
```
Output:
```
What do you want to say? Something
You: Something
```
### but watch out!
```python
print("You: ", user_input - 5)
```
This will give you an error!

Because the input function returns a string so it thinks you are trying to subtract a number from a word!
