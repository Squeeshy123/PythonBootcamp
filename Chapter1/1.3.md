# 1.3: The eval() function

### With the eval() function, we can turn strings in to numbers.

```python
evaluation = eval("159")
print(evaluation - 100)
```
Output:
```
59
```

### You can also turn strings of mathematical functions and evaluate them

```python
math_eval1 = eval("100 - 50")
math_eval2 = eval("50 / 2")
math_eval3 = eval("1000 * 42")
print(math_eval1, math_eval2, math_eval3)
```
Output:
```
50 25.0 42000
```
That `25.0` is because when dividing in python it turns that number into a floating point value (which is basically a number with a decimal point).
